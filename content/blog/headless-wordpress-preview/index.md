Gatsby is an open source framework based on React that builds static pages server side, allowing lightning fast loading of web pages on browsers. In a headless stack, Wordpress serves as a data layer for pushing your content (posts, pages, menus etc.) to Gatsby, which then uses this data to build your static pages. In this post I will show you how I was able to enable the preview of posts in the Wordpress Admin UI.

### Initial Setup

If you already have a Gatsby project and a Wordpress instance set up, you can skip this section `javascript±test code`.

```javascript
const code = null;
```
